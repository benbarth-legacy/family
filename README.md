### Q: Hey! What am I doing here?
A: Self-isolation is more fun together! _Separately._

### Q: What's in store for this evening?
A: A virtual games night!

### Q: How are we going to play?
A: With Zoom! I'll share the game screen, and you can play using your own devices.

### Q: What will I need?
A:
  1. 💻 You'll need a computer or tablet to watch the game on. (This will be running Zoom.)
  2. 📱 Every person will need their own phone (or tablet) to play. I'll send this link out once we've started.
  3. Some sort of snack 🍫, probably a beverage 🍷, and your A-game 💪.
